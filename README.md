# Working with Objects

### Objective

The objective of this repository is to work through multiple examples of state and behavior using example JavaScript objects.

### How to use

* Clone this repository
* `cd` into the directory this repository is cloned in
* Run individual files with:

  ```
  jasmine spec/filename.js
  ```

* Run all specs with:

  ```
  jasmine
  ```

* Your code will live in `house.js`, `refrigerator.js` and a file you will add. A reminder that the course is about finding and looking for patterns. Do not hesitate to use other work to see how things are set up.

### Recommendations

The recommended order for working through test files is:

1. `spec/refrigerator_spec.js`
1. `spec/house_spec.js`
1. `spec/air_conditioner_spec.js` (_Hint:_ This one will require some more set up than the others)
