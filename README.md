# Working with Objects

### Objective

The objective of this repository is to work through multiple examples of OOP style
JavaScript, exploring state and behavior using JavaScript constructors.

### How to use

* Clone this repository
* `cd` into the directory
* `npm install chai`
* Run individual test files with:

  ```
  mocha test/filename.test.js
  ```

* Run all tests with:

  ```
  mocha
  ```

* Your code will live in `house.js` and `air_conditioner.js`

__REMEMBER HOW TO PRACTICE TDD__

* Red - watch the test fail and read the error message
* Green - write the least amount of necessary code to get test to pass
* Refactor - ask yourself if you can write cleaner code ( well named variables etc)
* `commit, add, push` after each passing test
